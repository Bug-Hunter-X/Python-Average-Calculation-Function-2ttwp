# Python Average Calculator

This repository contains a Python function designed to calculate the average of a list of numbers. The function includes error handling for empty lists to prevent ZeroDivisionError exceptions. This example showcases robust coding practices in Python.

## Function: `calculate_average(numbers)`

The `calculate_average` function takes a list of numbers as input and returns their average. If the input list is empty, it gracefully returns 0, avoiding errors. 

The function demonstrates a common scenario in programming: handling potential errors that can arise from unexpected inputs.  This is an essential part of producing reliable code.
